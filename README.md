# Code
Various Matlab scripts for analysis of Freesurfer and fMRI data. Also contains analysis for epigenetic data and longitudinal head circumference in autism

Much of this code is dedicated to my dissertation topic of what neuroplasticity is present following central vision loss. To answer this questions we collected both T1 structural data and functionalMRI. The code starting with group_ttest, pairtest, and ttest_,  are analyses of functional connectivity between ROIs in primary visual cortex and a set of ROIs involved in executive control. Much of the other scripts not used for the fcMRI analyses are for use with Freesurfer analysis of T1 structural MRI data. There are two files with plotting and analysis of longitudinal autism research data (plot_headcirc, headcirc_plot). Finally, gene_overlap and Dir_analysis are scripts to investigate changes in gene expression from epigenetic data.
